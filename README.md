## Deployment
Used gunicorn for production, because Gunicorn is a WSGI server that takes care
of everything which happens in-between the web server and the web application.
It is used because it is stable and can handle more requests at once and is very fast.

Docker deploy
1. Go to your root folder where the Dockerfile is located: Run this
```
docker build -t aws-api .
```
2. Run the docker image
```
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 aws-api
```
Access the aws-api on ```localhost:5000/api/v1```
